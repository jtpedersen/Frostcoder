A simple 2d gcode to frostcode converter

Frostcoder is made to work on gcode files generated by gcodetools for
inkscape. It is not guaranteed to work with anything but simple
code. That is no arcs, exotic drill cycles or machine settings - and
not parametrized gcode.

However it is believed that it is a straightforward way to convert a
2d path for the frostruder.

HOWTO

$ make init		//generates build & bin directories etc
$ make 	    		// compiles
$ cd bin
$ ./frostcoder inputfile.ngc outputfile.ngc
$ emacs outputfile.ngc 	     //edit the variables to fit

Frostcoder introduces parameters into to the gcode such that the
frosting dispenser rate may be modified to fit viscosity
etc. Furthermore scaling and translation is supported.
