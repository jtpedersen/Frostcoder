A simple 2d gcode to frostcode converter

A is made to work on gcode files generated by gcodetools for
inkscape. It is not guaranteed to work with anything but simple
code. That is no arcs or exotic drill cycles / machine settings - and
no parametrized gcode - this will be generated.

However it is believed that it is a straightforward way to convert a
2d path for the frostruder.

HOWTO

$ make init		//generates build & bin directories etc
$ make 	    		// compiles
$ cd bin
$ ./frostcoder inputfile.ngc outputfile.ngc
$ emacs outputfile.ngc 	     //edit the variables to fit

frostcoder introduces parameter into to the gcode such that the
frosting dispenser rate may be modified to fit viscosity
etc. Furthermore scaling and translation is supported.
